# Integrated Photonic Systems: From Quantum Noise Detection to Nonlinear Processors
## Overview
This repository presents a suite of experimental and computational projects at the intersection of **integrated quantum photonics**, **nonlinear optical computing**, and **precision electro-optical and control engineering**. My work is unified by a system-level philosophy: integrating optical dynamics, custom electronic interfaces, and advanced control/learning algorithms to overcome fundamental physical bottlenecks. 

Through tight co-design of nanophotonic interfaces, low-noise electronics, and learning-enabled control algorithms, I address three critical challenges:
- **Quantum-limited detection** on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) chips via shot-noise-limited balanced homodyne detection (19.6 dB SNL clearance and 26.4 dB CMRR).
- **End-to-end trainable nonlinear optics** using second-harmonic generation (SHG), enabled by a noise-aware digital twin and constraint-aware optimization—achieving **85% accuracy on vowel recognition**.
- **Robust dynamic laser cleaning** for microwave-to-optical transduction, solving repeated lock–unlock failures through hardware–software co-design and custom analog filtering (208 µV RMS noise).

#### Technical Skills Demonstrated
Simulation/Design: Full 3D FDTD/EME simulations, KiCad PCB Layout, FreeCAD fabrication layouts. 
Software/AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Physics-Aware Training, surrogate gradient learning, automated lab control (Python/telnetlib). 
Hardware: Micro-soldering (castellated pads), RF impedance matching, analog circuit design.

These projects exemplify a **systems-first approach** to next-generation photonic technologies—where optical physics, electronic engineering, and neural networks converge to unlock new capabilities in quantum sensing, nonlinear optcis, analog computing, and quantum transduction.
