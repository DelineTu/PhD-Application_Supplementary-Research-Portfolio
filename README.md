# Hybrid-Quantum-Nonlinear-Photonics_Control-Learning
Hybrid research in experimental photonics: 1) Shot-noise-limited squeezing detection on TFLN with 19.6 dB shot noise clearance; 2) Hardware-in-the-loop nonlinear computing via SHG &amp; noise-aware digital twins (85% vowel recognition); 3) State-dependent M2O transduction control using custom summing-amp circuits &amp; Python-GPIB automation.

This repository presents a suite of experimental and computational projects at the intersection of **integrated quantum photonics**, **nonlinear optical computing**, and **precision control systems**. Developed as part of my PhD research, these works demonstrate a unifying philosophy: **treat photonic hardware not as a passive device, but as an active, trainable, and state-aware computational element**.

Through tight co-design of nanophotonic interfaces, low-noise electronics, and learning-enabled control algorithms, I address three critical challenges:
- **Quantum-limited detection** on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) chips via shot-noise-limited balanced homodyne detection (73.4% efficiency, 19.6 dB SNL clearance).
- **End-to-end trainable nonlinear optics** using second-harmonic generation (SHG), enabled by a noise-aware digital twin and constraint-aware optimization—achieving **85% accuracy on vowel recognition** without differentiable hardware.
- **Robust dynamic laser cleaning** for microwave-to-optical transduction, solving repeated lock–unlock failures through hardware–software co-design and custom analog filtering (208 µV RMS noise).

These projects exemplify a **systems-first approach** to next-generation photonic technologies—where optical physics, electronic engineering, and machine learning converge to unlock new capabilities in quantum sensing, analog computing, and transduction.
